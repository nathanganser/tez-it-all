# Tez it all

TezItAll.org is a social cryptocurrency experiment that employs some gamification concepts to incentivize people to participate.

## How does it work?

Anyone can bid their Tez by sending coins to the smart contract. If you manage to stay the highest bidder for 24 hours, you can claim all the Tez that have been sent to the contract.

## How to win

Simply bid an amount that is higher than the current highest bid and don't let anyone outbid you for 24 hours. But the more money is stacked in the smart contract, the more others will be incentivized to outbid you :)
